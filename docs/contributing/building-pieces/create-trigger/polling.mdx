The way polling triggers usually work is as follows:

**On Enable:**
Store the last timestamp or most recent item id using the context store property.

**Run:**
This method runs every **5 minutes**, fetches the endpoint between a certain timestamp or traverses until it finds the last item id, and returns the new items as an array.

**Testing:**
You cannot test it with Test Flow, as it uses static sample data provided in the piece. 
To test the trigger, publish the collection, perform the event, and wait for the run to be invoked (every 5 minutes) on the third party. Then check the flow runs from the main dashboard.

**Examples:**
